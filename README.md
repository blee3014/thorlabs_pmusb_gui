# thorlabs_pmusb_gui
tkinter based GUI for Thorlabs PMUSB for mac and linux

For macOS, I've noticed tkinter does not work when running on Python 3.10.
I've tested on 3.12, and from online forums, it seems like minimal python version is >= 3.11 (needs to be tested)

main dependencies are:
pyvisa
pyvisa-py
pyusb
libusb
